-# SORRY FOR THE HISTORY CHANGES! #
+This engine is currently capable of:
+ - start a map e.g. via `map mp_shop` and play on it, but it crashes once you shoot a bullet (some netmsg crash)
+ - however, you can compile this ioquake3-sof2 engine https://github.com/sof2plus/sof2plus-engine and play on it nicely
+ 
+Current issues:
+ - `cg_thirdperson 1`, the player won't have a weapon in his hands: https://youtu.be/5Ec_ipUoRGs?t=344
+ - `alt+tab` doesn't work in `r_fullscreen 1`, so better use `r_fullscreen 0`
 
-For legal reasons we had to make changes to the history. This likely broke every forker's repo. See [here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase.html#_recovering_from_upstream_rebase) for how to fix if you've changed anything, or just delete your github fork and local folder and start over if you haven't.
+To compile sof2plus engine/game, just do:
+ 
+```
+mkdir ~/sof2plus
+cd ~/sof2plus

-## Changelog ##
+If you want to run your SoF2 server permanently you can use `screen`:
 
-### Major Changes ###
-* The Jedi Academy singleplayer now searches for jagamex86.dll in the mod's folder, too, meaning SP Code mods are possible.
-* Increased Command Buffer from 16384 to 128*1024
-* Increased max cvars from 1224 to 2048
-* Removed unnecessary xbox code.
+```
+apt-get install screen
+screen -AmdS sof2
+screen -x sof2
+./sof2plus.x86_64 +set sv_pure 0 +rconPassword asd +devmap mp_shop
+# your terminal is inside the screen now, you can leave with hold-ctrl-key + a + d
+```
 
-### Minor Changes ###
-* Added mouse-wheel to console
-* Added misc security fixes to allow servers to deal with connectionless packets.
-* Added security fixes to prevent servers from spoofing clients with connect packets.
-* Added security fixes to prevent anyone from spoofing clients with print packets.
-* Compiles/runs with VS2012.
-* Fixed clients being able to set IP via cvar.
-* Fixed MiniHeapSize issue in SP
-* Fixed widescreen resolution changes causing black screen when UI restarted.
-* Fixed crash when trying to run custom resolutions with a local server.
-* Fixed crash related to ragnos NPC in MP
-* Fixed Gamma Clamp on WinXP+
-* Fixed buffer overflow in client side rcon command.
-* (Un)Pausing the MP game in solo play now results in smoother transition.
-* Tweaks to the cvar code to make it more strict in terms of read only/cheats/init.  Fixes a lot of broken rules with cvars.
-* Cheats are now defaulted to 1 in menu.  Do not be alarmed, starting normally will disable them or connecting to a non-cheat server. This allows cheats to work properly while playing back demos.
-* Fixed cvar commands that allow you to "cg_thirdPerson !" prevent you from typing out longer strings starting with a ! as the value.
-* Optimized MP shader loader.  This also fixes some cases where duplicate shaders that are wrong were being used.
-* Add fx_flashRadius (Defaults to 11) To set the size of FX flash radius. ("Rockets")  Set to 0 to disable completely.
-* Add sv_lanForceRate (Defaults to 1) Feature was already enabled, but not toggleable.
-* Timescale frametime fixes.  Frametime < 1 is no longer possible (bad things happen)
-* Tweaked globalservers master server command a bit for better verbosity.
-* Fixed a lot of formatting security holes.
-* Several Out-of-bounds memory access and memory leaks fixed.
-* Added fontlist command.  Useful for when making mods with custom fonts.
-* New serverside kick commands kickall kickallbots and kicknum (alias).
-* Improved command line parsing based off of ioquake3 patches.
-* Improved echo command by preserving colors based off of ioquake3 patches.
-* Improved GL_Extensions using ioquake3 to prevent crashes on newer cards.
-* Removed CD Check Code
-* Removed CD Key Code
-* Removed demo restriction code.
-* Removed Anti-Tamper Code.
-* Shift-Escape will now also open the console as an alternate (ie: keyboard doesn't support the normal console key)
-* Removed shift key requirement to open console

-## Known Bugs ##
+Compile/build instructions:
+ - simply clone or download this repo
+ - open OpenSoF2MP\codemp\OpenJK.sln with Visual Studio
+ - right-click on SoF2MP project and fix the command line argument in the "Debugging" section
+    - e.g. to: `+set fs_basepath F:\sof2_gold +set sv_pure 0`
+ - just press F5 to run it
 
-* Missing Known Bugs list
+Suggested settings:
+ - `r_fullscreen 0`
+ - `r_customwidth 1900`
+ - `r_customheight 900`
+ - obviously fix the width/height to your desktop resolution, my is 1920x1080
+ - I suggest `r_fullscreen 0`, because alt+tab is buggy atm, you can't leave the window otherwise
+ - now just open console (tilde/grave key under ESC), to free the game-focus/mouse and use other stuff on desktop (or e.g. fix SoF2 window position on desktop)
+ 
+Old/original description of kneirinck:
 
-## Mod Developer Notes ##
-* If your mod intends to use engine "hax" to figure out the nedaddr types (NA_IP, etc) NA_BAD is now 0 and NA_BOT is now 1 instead of vice versa.
+Getting Soldier of Fortune 2 Multiplayer to work by using a heavily modified JK engine.
